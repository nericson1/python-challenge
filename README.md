## DataFrame Column Shift
I looked up how to realign rows of a column in a dataframe as I needed the new "Difference" column in the PyBank dataframe to shift up in order to compare values with those of adjacent columns. Line 14 in PyBank/main.py was borrowed from the Stack Overflow link below.

## Max Values
I looked up how to find the maximum value of a column. I needed this to determine the winner of the PyPoll challenge. This was used in line 31 of PyPoll/main.py.

## Number Rouding
I looked up how to use the round function to round a number to a specific number of decimal places since some results required 2 decimal places and other results required 3 decimal places. This was used in lines 39-41 of PyPoll/main.py and in line 39 of PyBank/main.py.
